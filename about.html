        <p>Hello. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and for taking a look at the work I have done. My name is Spencer Tucker, and I am a college student at Eastern Washington University working towards a degree in Graphic Design. I am a native Washintonion, born and raised on the western side of the state. I am 23 years old, and have asperations to work with the Seattle Seahawks. However, should that not come to fruition, I would love to be able to work as a graphic designer just about anywhere. </p>
