        <p>Hello. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and for taking a look at the work I have done. My name is Spencer Tucker, and I am a college student at Eastern Washington University working towards a degree in Graphic Design. I am a native Washintonion, born and raised on the western side of the state. I am 23 years old, and have asperations to work with the Seattle Seahawks. However, should that not come to fruition, I would love to be able to work as a graphic designer just about anywhere. </p>

        <blockquote><i>“Empty your mind, be formless, shapelss-like water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup, you put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle, you put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”</i> - Bruce Lee</blockquote>
